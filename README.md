# quindar-groundtrack
Ground track (orbit trajectory) directive to display spacecraft vehicle's actual orbit movement and trajectory, etc.  Idea inspired by angular-d3 or nvd3.

The aungular-groundtrack.js is a directive file that plot a world map, ground stations, and satellite trajectories.  The trajectory data is streamed through the SocketIO.  
Two examples are included.  One is a stand alone version, and the another one is a widget version.
